1.base dataset- d1-salaries.csv

2. d1-player_info
cols: birthday, startyear, position, height, weight
issues:
- two players have the same name and start year, so for now filtered out
- college not dealt with since some have multiple colleges
- only really has data from 1996-2019
- has nulls so will need to clean more

3. d2-Season_Stats.csv
cols: MP(minutes played), PTS(points), Age, team, games(games played), games_started, PER(player efficiency rating),
FTr(free throw rating), AST(assists), STL(steals), TRB(total rebounds), FT(free throws), 3P(three points), FG(field goals)
issues:
- it has from 1950-2017, so dropped before but not after yet
- has nulls so need to look
